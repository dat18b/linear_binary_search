# Linear & Binary search Algorithms

## Binary Search
1. To be able to perform a binary search the array or list we are working on must be sorted.  
2. Then you look at the middle element in the list.  
   * if the middle element is smaler than the element you are searching for, then the element you are searching for is in the right half of the list. 
   * if the middle element is larger than the element you are searching for, then the element you are searching for is in the left half of the list. 
3. You through away the part of the list you do not need anymore and keep the part where your number might be. 
4. then you perform step 2 again until you find the element you are looking for, or if not, then the element is not in the list.
